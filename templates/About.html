						<p>Result of this research will be to present a system which will analyse, correlate and predict the crimes from huge data available. Results will be in the form of correlation between various crime and location of crime i.e. state/city. Crime can also be correlated on the basis of age group, location of crime & type of crime. Prediction of the crime will be presented using various techniques and Algorithm.
	Another point noted is that the crime rate is increasing and crime prevention has become an upheaval task. The legal force departments around the world are required to remain ahead in the eternal race between lawbreakers and law enforcers. So we are presenting the system which maintains, predict and visualize the crime records and the people who are involved whether the Government official or the Police or it may be guilty.
</p><p>
This System is  designed specifically for crime analysis have been created to perform functions that are not available in other existing software.Thus, it can be understood
that, even though several solutions to solve the problem has been proposed it can be seen that a perfect solution to each city, state and country is still elusive.

					<h3>What We Do</h3>
						<p>Exploring and detecting crimes and their relationships with criminals. Applying data mining techniques made criminology an appropriate field due to the high volume of crime datasets and also the complexity of relationships between these kinds of data.
       This is an ideal crime analysis tool which would be able to identify crime patterns quickly and in an efficient manner for future crime pattern detection and action.
<br>The purpose is to help ascertain incidence and patterns of the crimes using data mining techniques and data visualization. </p>
